# CookbookSpring
A Spring Boot backend I wrote for someone who wanted to create a Social Networking/Cookbook application. It can peform CRUD operations, programmatically connect to AWS, and has clear models for the different domains. It uses a limited set of data using an internal H2 database but could be expanded to be a fully functional API by connecting it to an external one.
